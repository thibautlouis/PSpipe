A list of planck maps used in the likelihood is available:

Plik used the half-mission maps.


The mask can be found on the PLA:

https://pla.esac.esa.int/#maps

Go to PR2 2015, mask, and then likelihood mask you will find P70,P50,P41 and T66,T57,T47 corresponding to the masks used in the likelihood paper.

The beams can be found in the planck_beam folder, I didn't find the corresponding 2015 one so let's use 2018 ones. I take them from files of the form 'BeamWf_HFI_R3.01/Bl_T_R3.01_fullsky_%s.fits' from the PLA.
